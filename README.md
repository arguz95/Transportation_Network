# Transportation_Network

#Simple example 1

Maersk is running a fleet of ships to take supplies in south east Asia to destinations in the west.

#The numbers next to cities show the supply or demand in the city in tonnes.
#The numbers on the graph show the cost in $ per tonne of material shipped.

Refer to Data.png for info and Jupyter notebook Transportation_Network_matrix.ipynb.

The objective is to meet the demand in the destination countries given the supplies in the producing countries at the lowest cost possible. Formulate an LP to address the Maerskâ€™s problem.
